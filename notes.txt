Given the sheer number of possibilites, sensors, integrations,  theres unlimited possibilities.
Current:
i2c LCD, listening to computer audio, (I dont have any i2c ADCs to run a microphone, so computer audio is fine.)
pip install pyaudio
fails.
sudo apt install portaudio19-dev
then
pip install pyaudio

Success!
