Given the sheer number of possibilites, sensors, integrations,  theres unlimited possibilities.
Current:
i2c LCD, listening to computer audio, (I dont have any i2c ADCs to run a microphone, so computer audio is fine.)
pip install pyaudio
fails.
sudo apt install portaudio19-dev
then
pip install pyaudio

Success!

ok, been hitting this for a minute. got some issues. The constants are the device addresses, but on any given system, 
the bus could differ, which means we're editing code every time we want to run a program on a different computer.
That is a pain in the butt.

I tried writing a class library to take addresses, and return busses, but this isnt working properly yet. 
Auto enumeration is the goal, or something close to that. 


it could be my own ignorance, but the enumeration of i2c devices is not automatic on linux systems, its more like
a device responds to a probe if present. There are differnt means of probing, and various devices respond in different ways.
need to look more at the quick-write functions which are for some devices, and other functional methods.
